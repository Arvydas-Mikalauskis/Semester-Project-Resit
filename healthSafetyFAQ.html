            <h3 class="question">How do I book a tour?</h3>
            <p class="answer">

            <h3 class="question">Prices</h3>
            <p class="answer">
              Our tours are most often created with a specific group of people
              in mind, so our prices vary. Contact us for more information.
            </p>
            <h3 class="question">What do I need to bring?</h3>
            <p class="answer">
              We encourage hikers to pack sensibly and bring their own
              appropriate clothing and gear. We are always well-stocked and
              prepared, just in case you have forgotten something or would
              rather travel light. Be aware that our package prices do not
              include extra equipment!
            </p>
            <h3 class="question">Insurance</h3>
            <p class="answer">
              We offer a special all-inclusive insurance package which covers
              all aspects of a tour. Contact us for more information about this
            </p>
            <h3 class="question">Accessibility</h3>

            Scaling a 2,000 meter summit may seem possible from the perspective
            of your living room, but you need to make sure you are in good
            enough shape to do so! While it may be tempting to book the most
            demanding trail for your first hike, it may make sense to start with
            something a little easier. If you have a medical condition this also
            should be taken into account. Some trips may require vaccinations,
            be sure to check on the details provided.

          <h3 class="advice" id="advice3">Be humble</h3>
          <p id="advice3_paragraph">
            Some cultures may frown on certain forms of dress or behaviour, and
            it is expected that our travellers respect these customs, regardless
            of whether or not one agrees with them. Our environmental policy is
            "leave a place tidier than you found it". It is taken as a given
            that our guests show respect for the environment, such that future
            travellers also may enjoy it.
